# Vision por computadora 1 (VPC1) - Computer Vision 1

## TP1

- White Patch Algorithm (slow and fast implementations).
- Chromatic Coordinates.
- Histogram analysis.
- Segmentation using OpenCV masks.

## TP2

- Filters:
    - Kernels
    - Spatial (using convolution).
    - In frequency (using FFT).

- Focus measure algorithms:
     - Based on "Image Sharpness Measure for Blurred Images in Frequency Domain" paper.
     - WAV3, WAV1 and LAP based on â€œAnalysis of focus measure operators in shape from focus" paper.

## TP3

- Template matching
    - Applying filters to ease detection.
    - At different scales.
    - Multiple matching.
